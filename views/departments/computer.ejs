            <p class="pa">The department is well equipped with two computer labs consisting more than 150 computers and 6 DELL power edge servers. Microprocessor lab and Digital lab are also available for training the students in basic hardware skills. The internet connection with 40 Mbps leased line facility is available for accessing information through internet. The department strives and takes efforts to make the students strong in core subjects like data structures, operating systems etc. and programming skills.
            </p>

            <p class="pa">
                The department organizes a national level technical symposium every year. The students are encouraged to participate and showcase their talents in competitions and workshops conducted by various reputed institutions and organizations all over India. The students are motivated to do mini-projects in various fields based on their interest. Many students are doing mini-projects particularly in open-source platforms like Linux and mobile operating systems like android, ios, windows etc. The department organizes guest lectures by experts both from industry and academia to enable the students aware of current trends. Every classroom is equipped with audiovisual facilities and one A/C seminar hall with capacity of 150 seats is also available for presentations and brainstorming sessions. The department has consistent placement record both in on-campus and off-campus. Many of the alumni continue their higher studies both in India and abroad. Our faculty members and alumni are the prime strength of our department.
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 15px;">As per the curriculum of the University, the following core subjects are taught during the course of study</h4>
